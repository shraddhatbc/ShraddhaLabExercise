The Words app codelab source code is contained in this folder. This app is designed to allow users to select a letter and use Intents to navigate to an Activity that displays words starting with that letter. Additionally, each word can be looked up via a web search. The app includes a RecyclerView with a scrollable list of 26 letters from A to Z, and the orientation can be changed between a vertical list or a grid of items. The Intents are demonstrated in two ways: first, by navigating to a specific destination within the app and second, by allowing Android to service the Intent using the apps and resources available on the device. The Words app is a useful demonstration of how Intents can be used to navigate within and outside of an app, as well as how RecyclerViews can be implemented to display data in various ways.
