 In the project, successfully added a button to an Android app using the Layout Editor. To ensure that the button was working correctly, modified the
 MainActivity.kt class and added interactive behavior to the app. Created a temporary solution to verify that the app was functioning as expected 
 by implementing a pop-up Toast message. To add functionality for when the button was clicked, We set an on-click listener using the setOnClickListener() method.
 Finally, while running the app, it is able to update the screen by calling methods on the UI elements, such as TextView and Button, that were present in the layout.
